# SDR-Luminance-Survey

* Please place the files in this respository on a USB stick and plug into your TV for playback.
    * Measure the center image first (peak white)
    * Measure NBCU midgray downmap next
    * Measure BBC midgray downmap next

* Measuring Methods
    * Use a spot meter with Calman (or equivalent) using any workflow that will give you a nit value (cd/m<sup>2</sup>).
    * Use this display luminance meter: [SM208 Screen Luminance Meter via Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H050VEI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
    * Use a LUX meter with a display that is 55" or above and then convert LUX to nits 200cd/m<sup>2</sup> should equal 628Lux (cd/m<sup>2</sup>=LUX*3.14)
        * Placement of the LUX meter must be right over the pattern and fill extend several inches past each side of the meter. 

<p>These files include full range PNG-16bit and JPEG-8bit files using SDR-BT.709 and Gamma 2.4</p>

<p>There are also 10bit ProRes-Proxy QuickTime Movies and HEVC Main10 MP4 wrapped versions of in narrow range, SDR-BT.709-Gamma2.4</p> 
 
<p>The center image is peak white (100% Nominal Video Level)</p>

<p>The left image is an SDR image using NBCU LUT3 converted from HLG 38% signal level ("mid-gray" or 26nits when normalized at 1,000nits</p>
 
<p>The right image is an SDR image using BBC LUT9 converted from HLG 38% signal level ("mid-gray" or 26nits when normalized at 1,000nits</p>

<p>LUTs for the Resolve 17 project are available here:</p>
